# Idea to Action

Use this skill when the user has a raw idea and wants to convert it into a concrete, executable plan.

## Core Philosophy
*   **Brainstorm → Filter → Execute**: Don't just list ideas; curate them for viability.
*   **From Zero to System**: Move from "what if" to "how it works".
*   **Think Like a Founder**: Focus on ROI, feasibility, and speed to market.
*   **Reality-First Mode**: Ignore the hype; focus on what is actually buildable today.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: The Founder's Summary
*   **Input**: Listen to the user's raw idea.
*   **Action**: Summarize the core value proposition.
    *   *Constraint*: Filter out feature creep. focus on the specific problem being solved.
    *   *Output*: A clear, concise statement of "What is this?" and "Why does it assume it will work?"

### Phase 2: Deep Dive (System Architecture)
*   **Action**: Expand the summary into a system view.
    *   What are the moving parts?
    *   What are the inputs and outputs?
    *   What is the "secret sauce" or key differentiator?

### Phase 3: The Execution Plan
Convert the system view into actionable steps. Provide the following sections:
1.  **Actionable Steps**: A checklist of 5-10 concrete items to start *right now*.
2.  **Schedule**: A tentative timeline (e.g., "Day 1: Prototype", "Day 3: User Tests").
3.  **Risk Analysis**:
    *   *Technical Risks*: What might break?
    *   *Market/Product Risks*: Will anyone care?
4.  **Multilevel Explanations**:
    *   *The Pitch (ELI5)*: How to explain it to a 5-year-old (or an investor).
    *   *The Specs (Technical)*: How to explain it to an engineer.
