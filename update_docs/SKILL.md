# Update Documentation

This skill systematically updates the core documentation files of the project.

## Workflow

1.  **Analyze Changes**: Briefly scan the recent changes in the codebase to understand what functionality has been added, modified, or removed.

2.  **Update README.md**:
    *   **Focus**: "HOW TO'S".
    *   Ensure installation and usage instructions are up to date.
    *   Add any new features to the feature list.
    *   Verify prerequisites and configuration steps.

3.  **Update CODE_DOCUMENTATION.md**:
    *   **Focus**: "Code functionality - crisp, clear, and simple".
    *   Describe the technical implementation of new features.
    *   Update architecture diagrams or descriptions if flow has changed.
    *   Keep it concise; avoid over-explaining standard boilerplate.

4.  **Update DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md**:
    *   **Focus**: "Why and what are we trying to do - ideology".
    *   Explain the *reasoning* behind recent major changes.
    *   Re-align the document with the project's evolving goals if necessary.
    *   Ensure the tone reflects the project's core values.

5.  **Review**: Check for consistency across all three documents.
